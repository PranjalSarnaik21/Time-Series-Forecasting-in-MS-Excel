# Time-Series-Forecasting-in-MS-Excel

## Overview
This project demonstrates time series forecasting techniques using Microsoft Excel. It covers various methods for forecasting future views of a YouTube channel based on historical data. The project includes explanations of forecasting concepts, demonstration of different forecasting methods, and practical application on a sample dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains YouTube channel data, specifically the number of views over a period of time. It consists of two main variables:
- **Date**: Represents the dates on which data were collected.
- **Views**: Represents the number of views received by the YouTube channel on each respective date.

## Forecasting Methods
Three main forecasting methods are covered in this project:
1. **Formula method**: Using mathematical formulas or functions in Excel to create forecasts, such as moving averages or exponential smoothing.
2. **Graph-trendline method**: Visual analysis of historical data by plotting it on a graph in Excel and adding a trendline to forecast future values.
3. **Forecast sheet**: Utilizing Excel's built-in "Forecast Sheet" feature to automate the process of generating forecasts based on historical data.
